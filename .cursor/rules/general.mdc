- Structure the CSS, keep the file size small. If required, split the CSS into multiple files to keep overview
- Always consider that the page has a light and a dark mode
- Always make the site work perfectly on mobile and desktop. Try to use the additional space on the desktop version.
- When changing the design, directly modify the theme. This theme is a custom made theme only for this site. It doesn't have to be re-usable for other sites.
