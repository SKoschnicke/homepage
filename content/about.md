Meet Sven Koschnicke, a passionate technologist with over 25 years of hands-on
experience across the entire technology stack. From designing microchips and
programming FPGAs to developing high-performance kernel modules, I bring deep
technical expertise at every level.

My unique strength lies in true full-stack mastery - seamlessly bridging
hardware, systems, and software. Whether it's DevOps infrastructure,
sophisticated backend services, or polished frontend applications, I've
successfully delivered solutions across the spectrum.

I specialize in tackling complex technical challenges that require innovative
thinking and optimization. While others might reach for off-the-shelf solutions
or basic CRUD applications (now easily handled by LLMs), I focus on creating
high-performance, specialized systems that push boundaries and deliver
exceptional value.

If you're looking for someone who can not only understand your technical
challenges from every angle but also architect and implement solutions that
exceed expectations in both performance and quality, let's connect.
