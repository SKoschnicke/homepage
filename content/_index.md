Welcome to my little home on the interwebs. I'm Sven Koschnicke, a computer nerd with over 25 years of software-engineering experience across the full technology stack - from hardware design and kernel modules to DevOps, backend services, and frontend applications.

Here you'll find my thoughts on technology, software development, and the occasional deep dive into interesting tools and techniques. Feel free to explore my [posts](/posts/) or learn more [about me](/about/).
